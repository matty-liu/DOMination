    <h1>DOMination</h1>
    <h2>A JavaScript library to help learn DOM manipulation and jQuery</h2>
    <p>Welcome to DOMination! <br><br>
      DOMination is a introductory JavaScript library designed primarily for beginners to begin manipulating the DOM (Document Object Manager). As fancy as the DOM may sound, the DOM is just the text and structural elements that we see on the page. A brief understanding of HTML will help immensely in understanding the DOM so what is HTML?</p>

    <p>HTML is Hypertext Markup Language. <br><br>
      So what does that mean? If we dive right into the nature of the words that make up HTML, it really is not all that bad.

      Hypertext is

      Markup is

      So HTML is a language that we use for our browser to interpret how to markup(style) the hypertext we see.

      Lets look at the HTML for the opening paragraph and title.</p>

      <p>Welcome to DOMination! DOMination is a introductory JavaScript library designed primarily for beginners to begin manipulating the DOM (Document Object Manager). As fancy as the DOM may sound, the DOM is just the text and structural elements that we see on the page (you'll hear HTML and XML often). A brief understanding of HTML and XML will help so we'll discuss how this library helps understand the DOM and the HTML structure.</p>

    <div>So what do the different tags as in
      <XMP class="tagsHTML"><h1>, <h2>, <p></XMP>
      stand for?
    </div>

    <p>It's actually quite semantic, h1 stands for header1, h2 for header2, and p for paragraph! Not too bad right?</p>

    <p>With this knowledge we can begin our first DOM manipulation! Let's change the h1 header text! So how do we do this? With DOMination, we have designed a function called $grab(HTMLelement). What $grab will do is grab the HTML element that we are interested in! For our purposes we only have one header so if we bind our $grab variable, we can grab our one HTML element in the DOM and reference it by the variable.</p>
